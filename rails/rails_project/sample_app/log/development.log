      pluralize(复数化)方法在控制台中默认不可用，不过我们可以引入 ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper 模块加载这个方法：
        >> include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper
        >> pluralize(1, "error")
        => "1 error"
        >> pluralize(5, "error")
        => "5 errors"
      如上所示，pluralize 方法的第一个参数是整数，返回值是这个数字和第二个参数文本组合在一起正确的单复数形式
      pluralize 方法是由功能强大的转置器（inflector）实现的，转置器知道怎么处理大多数单词的单复数变换，甚至是一些不规则的变换方式：
        >> pluralize(2, "woman")
        => "2 women"
        >> pluralize(3, "erratum")
        => "3 errata"
      所以，使用 pluralize 方法后，如下的代码
        ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") );@output_buffer.safe_append='
      返回值就是 "0 errors"、"1 error" 或 "2 errors"等，单复数形式取决于错误的数量。这样就可以避免类似 "1 errors" 这种低级的错误了（这是网络中常见的错误之一）。
      -->

@output_buffer.safe_append='      <li>#  '; =message ;@output_buffer.safe_append='</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
'; end
@output_buffer.to_s
          ensure
            @virtual_path, @output_buffer = _old_virtual_path, _old_output_buffer
          end

      pluralize(复数化)方法在控制台中默认不可用，不过我们可以引入 ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper 模块加载这个方法：
        >> include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper
        >> pluralize(1, "error")
        => "1 error"
        >> pluralize(5, "error")
        => "5 errors"
      如上所示，pluralize 方法的第一个参数是整数，返回值是这个数字和第二个参数文本组合在一起正确的单复数形式
      pluralize 方法是由功能强大的转置器（inflector）实现的，转置器知道怎么处理大多数单词的单复数变换，甚至是一些不规则的变换方式：
        >> pluralize(2, "woman")
        => "2 women"
        >> pluralize(3, "erratum")
        => "3 errata"
      所以，使用 pluralize 方法后，如下的代码
        ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") );@output_buffer.safe_append='
      返回值就是 "0 errors"、"1 error" 或 "2 errors"等，单复数形式取决于错误的数量。这样就可以避免类似 "1 errors" 这种低级的错误了（这是网络中常见的错误之一）。
      -->
      Error Messages Count ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error"));@output_buffer.safe_append='

    <!--逐行显示错误信息-->
    <ul>

@output_buffer.safe_append='      <li>#  ';@output_buffer.append=( message );@output_buffer.safe_append='</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
'; end
@output_buffer.to_s
          ensure
            @virtual_path, @output_buffer = _old_virtual_path, _old_output_buffer
          end

      pluralize(复数化)方法在控制台中默认不可用，不过我们可以引入 ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper 模块加载这个方法：
        >> include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper
        >> pluralize(1, "error")
        => "1 error"
        >> pluralize(5, "error")
        => "5 errors"
      如上所示，pluralize 方法的第一个参数是整数，返回值是这个数字和第二个参数文本组合在一起正确的单复数形式
      pluralize 方法是由功能强大的转置器（inflector）实现的，转置器知道怎么处理大多数单词的单复数变换，甚至是一些不规则的变换方式：
        >> pluralize(2, "woman")
        => "2 women"
        >> pluralize(3, "erratum")
        => "3 errata"
      所以，使用 pluralize 方法后，如下的代码
        ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") );@output_buffer.safe_append='
      返回值就是 "0 errors"、"1 error" 或 "2 errors"等，单复数形式取决于错误的数量。这样就可以避免类似 "1 errors" 这种低级的错误了（这是网络中常见的错误之一）。
      -->
      Error Messages Count ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error"));@output_buffer.safe_append='
    </div>
    
    <!--逐行显示错误信息-->
    <ul>
';       user.errors.full_message.each do |message| 
@output_buffer.safe_append='      <li>#  ';@output_buffer.append=( message );@output_buffer.safe_append='</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
'; end 
@output_buffer.to_s
          ensure
            @virtual_path, @output_buffer = _old_virtual_path, _old_output_buffer
          end

      pluralize(复数化)方法在控制台中默认不可用，不过我们可以引入 ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper 模块加载这个方法：
        >> include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper
        >> pluralize(1, "error")
        => "1 error"
        >> pluralize(5, "error")
        => "5 errors"
      如上所示，pluralize 方法的第一个参数是整数，返回值是这个数字和第二个参数文本组合在一起正确的单复数形式
      pluralize 方法是由功能强大的转置器（inflector）实现的，转置器知道怎么处理大多数单词的单复数变换，甚至是一些不规则的变换方式：
        >> pluralize(2, "woman")
        => "2 women"
        >> pluralize(3, "erratum")
        => "3 errata"
      所以，使用 pluralize 方法后，如下的代码
        ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") );@output_buffer.safe_append='
      返回值就是 "0 errors"、"1 error" 或 "2 errors"等，单复数形式取决于错误的数量。这样就可以避免类似 "1 errors" 这种低级的错误了（这是网络中常见的错误之一）。
      -->
      Error Messages Count ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error"));@output_buffer.safe_append='
    </div>
    
    <!--逐行显示错误信息-->
    <ul>
';       user.errors.full_message.each do |message| 
@output_buffer.safe_append='      <li>#  ';@output_buffer.append=( message );@output_buffer.safe_append='</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
'; end 
@output_buffer.to_s
          ensure
            @virtual_path, @output_buffer = _old_virtual_path, _old_output_buffer
          end

      pluralize(复数化)方法在控制台中默认不可用，不过我们可以引入 ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper 模块加载这个方法：
        >> include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper
        >> pluralize(1, "error")
        => "1 error"
        >> pluralize(5, "error")
        => "5 errors"
      如上所示，pluralize 方法的第一个参数是整数，返回值是这个数字和第二个参数文本组合在一起正确的单复数形式
      pluralize 方法是由功能强大的转置器（inflector）实现的，转置器知道怎么处理大多数单词的单复数变换，甚至是一些不规则的变换方式：
        >> pluralize(2, "woman")
        => "2 women"
        >> pluralize(3, "erratum")
        => "3 errata"
      所以，使用 pluralize 方法后，如下的代码
        ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") );@output_buffer.safe_append='
      返回值就是 "0 errors"、"1 error" 或 "2 errors"等，单复数形式取决于错误的数量。这样就可以避免类似 "1 errors" 这种低级的错误了（这是网络中常见的错误之一）。
      -->
      Error Messages Count ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error"));@output_buffer.safe_append='
    </div>
    
    <!--逐行显示错误信息-->
    <ul>
';       user.errors.full_message.each do |message| 
@output_buffer.safe_append='      <li>#  ';@output_buffer.append=( message );@output_buffer.safe_append='</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
'; end 
@output_buffer.to_s
          ensure
            @virtual_path, @output_buffer = _old_virtual_path, _old_output_buffer
          end

      pluralize(复数化)方法在控制台中默认不可用，不过我们可以引入 ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper 模块加载这个方法：
        >> include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper
        >> pluralize(1, "error")
        => "1 error"
        >> pluralize(5, "error")
        => "5 errors"
      如上所示，pluralize 方法的第一个参数是整数，返回值是这个数字和第二个参数文本组合在一起正确的单复数形式
      pluralize 方法是由功能强大的转置器（inflector）实现的，转置器知道怎么处理大多数单词的单复数变换，甚至是一些不规则的变换方式：
        >> pluralize(2, "woman")
        => "2 women"
        >> pluralize(3, "erratum")
        => "3 errata"
      所以，使用 pluralize 方法后，如下的代码
        ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") );@output_buffer.safe_append='
      返回值就是 "0 errors"、"1 error" 或 "2 errors"等，单复数形式取决于错误的数量。这样就可以避免类似 "1 errors" 这种低级的错误了（这是网络中常见的错误之一）。
      -->
      Error Messages Count ';@output_buffer.append=( pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error"));@output_buffer.safe_append='
    </div>
    
    <!--逐行显示错误信息-->
    <ul>
';       @@@@@@@@@user.errors.full_message.each do |message| 
@output_buffer.safe_append='      <li>#  ';@output_buffer.append=( message );@output_buffer.safe_append='</li>
';       end 
@output_buffer.safe_append='    </ul>
  </div>
'; end 
@output_buffer.to_s
          ensure
            @virtual_path, @output_buffer = _old_virtual_path, _old_output_buffer
          end
